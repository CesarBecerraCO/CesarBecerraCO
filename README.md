## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Cesar! 


I'm Electrical Engineer since 2006 and MSc since 2010. Since then I decided to learn about programing by my own, on my first steps I was able to use my HP48G+ and VBA Excel for creating applications oriented to Electrical Power Systems analysis and design.

Although the main industry where I Work is in Energy, Electrical Utilities and SCADA/ADMS Real Time Systems (SIEMENS, SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC), along the time I have been improving/updating/appliyng my skills on Software Development, Data Analysis and Visualization. I use as much of my free time to do it possible, it worth the effort and I love Tech.

I've experimented several technologies in the past like Java, C++, VB, nowadays more oriented to Python, Django, Git+GitHub, Microsoft Power Platform, BI, SQL Data Bases (MySQL, ORACLE, MS SQL SERVER, PosgreSQL), API's, JSON, XML. I also know a little of HTML, JS, CSS, CodeIgniter, React, Angular, Docker, Ruby on Rails.

My main soft skills: comunication, leadership, teamwork, flexibility, adaptability, continuous learning.

Well, this is what I consider a good "range", it allows me be more creative on what I do, having a better mindset structure and better problem-solving skills. Lifelong learning is the basis of my professional and personal growth.
